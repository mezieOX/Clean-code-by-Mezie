## What's clean code all about?
### Preface
In this book what's clean code all about?, you will understand and be enlighten fully about everything that ha sto do with Clean code.

## Definition
In my own world i tell you that "Clean code refers to code that is easy to understand, modify, extend and maintain".
According to **Martin Fowler** he wrote that "Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that human understand". In a situation where Programmed Code is - Hard to test, Hard to change, Has long file symptoms etc. All these things is a characteristics of **unclean code** as a good programmer you don't have to let your Code to have all these symptoms. The best part that interest me so much in this **Martin Fowler** book is the word that say's **"Write a Code that human understand"**

## Examples of Clean code
+ it must be easy to understand, change, test
+ Must follow general principle - eg. 
+ No matter what approach you're following, be sure to arrange things in the same way
+ Make the component short and concise
+ Choose a word with meaning in naming your functions, variables etc
+ Make necessary comments

## Note
The most frustrating thing about **Unclean code** is that when you want to apply a simple change to the existing code, even if you know that it's only one-line change. it's nearly impossible to make the change without braking something else, or sometimes not disgusting yourself. Another possibility is that you need to modify another place, and so on. it's a kind of **rabbit hole** to make that simple one-liner. The dead loop is that, because it's hard to change people tend to not change it but just add patches on it, which in turn make it even harder to change again ðŸ˜ž.
