## What's clean code all about?
### Preface
In this book what's clean code all about?, you will understand and be enlighten fully about everything that ha sto do with Clean code.

## Definition
In my own world i tell you that "Clean code refers to code that is easy to understand, modify, extend and maintain".
According to **Martin Fowler** he wrote that "Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that human understand". In a situation where Programmed Code is - Hard to test, Hard to change, Has long file symptoms etc. All these things is a characteristics of **unclean code** as a good programmer you don't have to let your Code to have all these symptoms. The best part that interest me so much in this **Martin Fowler** book is the word that say's **"Write a Code that human understand"**


## Examples of Clean code

+ No matter what approach you're following, be sure to arrange things in the same way
